My packages game is an escape room style mini game.
The player must work out the codes for the locks which will lead them to the final code to get out the room.
As a full length game there would be more levels and Mechanics.

This game makes use of multiple packages:

My Packages:
- Code Lock
- Object Highlight

Other Packages:
- First Person Character Controller
