	I spent a lot of time making theese packages as they also helped me developing the game for my third year.

	I got a lot of inspiration from youtube tutorials, but I adapted them to my necesities in the game that I'm about to make.

	The one I spent the most time on is the First Person Controller, but I know that this is the one that will come in handy the most in the future, 
because it's adapted to any First Person game. The Controller has a lot of functions and mechanics for the player, such as jumping, sprinting, crouching,
a health system, stamina system,zooming with rightlclick, sliding on slopes instead of getting stuck in the air, the ability to put different stepsounds 
for different materials and the ability to interact with objects and doors. The First Person Controller is fully customizable to the needs of the developer.

	The last 2 packages were focused on doors. One of them has an interactable door that always opens in the opposite direction of the player and closes 
automaticaly if the player doesn't stay next to the door anymore. The second one is a door that opens only with a passcode, the default code is 1234,
but it is fully customizable in the Unity Property Editor.

	It was a fun experience making theese packages and I hope I can use them more in the future.
