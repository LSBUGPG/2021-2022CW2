/*
 * This package allows you to create a procedual dungeon as a player starts the game.
 * In order to allow for this package to work simpily drag the StartingDungeonPiece into the unity environment.
 * The only way to alter the algorithm is to navigate the DungeonSpawn script in the scripts folder.
 * Go to line 15 which reads "bool wallActive = (Random.value > 0.65f);".
 * Alter the value 0.65f in order to change the probabilty of there being a wall or not.
 * 
 * You now have a random dungeon generator.
 * Enjoy - Jamie
