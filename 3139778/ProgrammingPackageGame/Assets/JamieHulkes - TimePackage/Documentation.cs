/*
 * This package defines the time of day and the date of the world.
 * This package offers a lot of customisation which can allow you to impliement anything from a real time date system to a fast moving fake time for a idle / tycoon game.
 * The main component to this (the TimeManager) has all of the options in the inspector you can edit in order to create a system that works best for your game.
 * There are three areas of customization avaliable within the inspector, Time Format, Date Format and Sec per Min.
 * Time Format gives you a drop down menu where you can chose weather you want to have a 12 hour clock or 24 hour clock - the 12 hour option gives you an am and pm indication for
 * the time of day.
 * Date Format gives you another drop down menu where you can chose between four formats for the time which is the english and then american formats then the same again but with the
 * year first.
 * Sec Per Min defines how many seconds are in a minute (basically speed).
 * So for example, if this is 60 the time will move in real time, however if this is 1 then every second in real life the game will have gone through a whole minute - this would make
 * an hour in game be a minute.
 * 
 * To get it in the game just drag and drop the prefab into your scene.
 * Enjoy - Jamie
