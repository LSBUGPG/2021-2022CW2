/*
 * This package has been created to allow you to quickly add dialog to NPC characters in your scene.
 * It offers the ability to quickly change what the character is saying, how much they say and how quickly they say it - all within one simple script, straight from the inspector.
 * Additionally you can change the name of the character within the CharacterNameText UI object which is a child of the main DialogManager within the prefab.
 * Everything else you may wish to edit is all in one place.
 * I have additionally added a tutorial as the sample text within the dialog text so it guides you as to how to edit everything specifically in the most intuitive way possible.
 * 
 * Enjoy! - Jamie
