**Grid Movement Tutorials Used**

From this tutorial I learnt how to move the player on a grid system controlling the directions they could go based on obstacles/height differences and the camera position which was something I was interested in for my AGP game. During the following of the tutorial I made many mistakes along the way such as not setting the right directions for the camera/player to rotate which I then rectified as well as the camera smoothing travelling way too fast making it look janky so I decreased the number.

**Door System Tutorial Used**

This tutorial taught me a lot of ways the player can interact with doors, the biggest challenge however was converting these methods from a 2D Space to a 3D one. A big issue I faced was that multiple objects did not work well with animation graphs causing only one button to work for a door instead of two meaning you would be trapped from the other side, because of this I had to change the way I animated some of the doors in order for them to work when duplicated even if this did mean losing some customisability.

**Main Menu**
For the Main Menu system I did not have any problems as I had worked on multiple main menus from previous projects at the University so I was able to pick my favourite pieces from all of them  and combine them.

**Player Camera Switch**
For the player camera switch I mainly based it off of the code I created in CW1 for the small 2D project, this time however I had to convert it to a 3D space since my other components were also 3D. The biggest challenge from this component was getting the camera to transition smoothly as well as centering over the players so that it did not leave a lot of awkward empty space.
